Scripts to calculate SNP distance for Application 2 and corresponding results:

`run_ska2_strict.sh` takes `ska_input.tsv` which lists the host filtered fastq files as input, and generate `distances_ska2_strict.txt` which is then used in `2.App2_plot_SNP_matrix.Rmd` to create the SNP matrix heatmap.
