## Scripts to calculate SNP distance for Application 2

`run_ska2_strict.sh` takes `ska_input.tsv` which lists the host-filtered fastq files (download [here](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/czid-amr-manuscript-2024/blob/main/code/Run_remove_unpaired.sh)) as input, and generate `distances_ska2_strict.txt` which is then used by `2.App2_plot_SNP_matrix.Rmd` to create the SNP matrix heatmap.
